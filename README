MiniWiki is a very simple wiki designed for mobile access. It is a demonstration project I developed to
learn a bit more about:

* HTML Local Storage
* Pure Javascript view generation (all pages are plain html, with all interaction done via Javascript/AJAX)
* JSON-only RESTful server (implemented in Python on Google App Engine)
* Offline operation and synchronization

This architecture, where the server serves up only static content (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) and simple REST-based
database calls, is, I think, where the future of web development is. As Javascript engines get faster, it no
longer makes sense to laboriously build up pages on the server. For one thing, if a javascript client is
handling things, you basically don't have to build a separate API for your application, since the API is
what you are using. Also, it should be easier to create mobile apps, either native (using the API) or web-based (customizing the existing Javascript client or css as needed).

The app itself implements two basic models, a Wiki, identified by a URL, and Articles within the Wiki.

You can try the app at http://nimbusly-miniwiki.appspot.com

You will first need to create a wiki with a PUT to http://nimbusly-miniwiki.appspot.com/<name>

If you then GET that url, you will see the wiki
